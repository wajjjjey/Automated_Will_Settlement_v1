Will Settlement Protocol
Will Settlement Protocol is a decentralized Ethereum-based application that enables any prospective testator to create and manage digital wills on the blockchain. The protocol allows users to securely distribute their digital assets (including ERC20 tokens and ERC721 non-fungible tokens) to designated beneficiaries upon their passing. The transfers are executed only after a specified number of executors confirm the will execution.

Features
Create and manage digital wills on the blockchain.
Securely distribute ERC20 tokens and ERC721 NFTs to designated beneficiaries.
Require confirmation from multiple executors before executing a will.
Built on Ethereum, utilizing the security and transparency of the blockchain.

Prerequisites
Before you can run the Will Protocol, ensure that you have the following tools installed:

Node.js (version >= 12.0.0)
npm (version >= 6.0.0)
Hardhat

I have put together the skeleton of a front-end to interact with the protocol, but right now it can be deployed and tested locally.
